# WaveMixSR

## Introduction

This codebase is based on the research paper titled: "WaveMixSR: Resource-efficient Neural Network for Image Super-resolution". 

Traditionally super resolution is based on transformers which are computationally expensive. This paper introduces a new architecture called WaveMixSR which is based on wavelet transforms. This architecture is computationally efficient offers similar performance to traditional transformer based super resolution models.
